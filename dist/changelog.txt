* added full keyboard control

	* keys 'A-Z' can now be used to type the letters instead of clicking them

	* when a letter can be found more than once in the player's inventory, a 		radial menu pops up and allows the player to select one

	* 'Backspace' can be used to deselect the last letter



* added the earliest version of the radial menu: it appears below the letterbar and displays 2-4 letters available for selection

* maximum amount per letter temporarily changed to 3 (from 2)

* everything that previously was bound to letter keys is now rebound:

	* Spell 1 - 'Q' : '6'
    
	* Spell 4 - 'R' : '9'
    
	* Spawn New Monster - 'M' : 'F2'
   
	* Reset - 'N' : 'F3'
    
	* Pause - 'P' : N/A
